### 🔬 Featured Project: Robotic Arm with Arduino

**Project Title:** *Construction of a Robotic Arm – Design, Assembly, and Programming*  
**Languages/Tools:** Arduino IDE, Tinkercad, App Inventor, 3D Printing  

This project focused on the full development of a **3D-printed robotic arm**, controlled via a **custom Android application** connected through Bluetooth.  
The arm features **five degrees of freedom**, combining MG996R and SG90 servo motors, and was programmed using **Arduino C++**.  

The control app allows real-time manual movement, recording, and automated playback of motion sequences.  
This project showcases skills in **mechanical design, embedded programming, mobile control systems, and signal integration**.
